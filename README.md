<h2>C:\$MFT\123</h2>

- Compatibility: Vista, 7, 8, 8.1
- Cause: Slow, and crash the system.
- How it works: Windows uses ‚Äú$MFT‚Äù for special metadata files that are used by NTFS file system, and Windows fail to handle this directory name correctly.
- How to reproduce the bug: There are several ways to exploit the exploit, you can simply call it from the windows searchbar, from cmd or powershell, and also from an html page (tested with windows explorer, but I think it works with all browsers) by calling a file in folder C:\$MFT\123.

<h2>C:\con\con, C:\Aux\Aux\, C:\nul\nul  </h2>

- Compatibility: 95, 98.
- Cause: BSOD.
- How it works: In DOS there are names called "Reserved Names", if you rename a file or folder or if it is called from the terminal or code the system crashes, this happens because in NT systems the DOS is not a real O.S. but is often referred to as "DOS box", it's not really DOS, but a command line interpreter (CLI).
- How to reproduce the bug: WIN+R,put the string, and run! Or you can trying to load an image from file:///c:/con/con from a webpage, or from cmd/bat file.
- Additional Infos: This bug affect also files. If for example you rename a file,  Microsoft have make a list with the "reserved Names": 
CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.
If you try a rename the file with one of this reserved name you will see this:
